An exploratory analysis about OWhat data.

QCYN was a talent reality show broadcasted in 2019 on iQiyi.com, franchised by Korean TV network Mnet. In this survival reality show, 100 "Trainee"s (idols-to-be) participated in a competition and fought to be part of an idol group limited to 9 members. Audiences of this show (fans, "youth producers") would vote to decide who would survive in each round; therefore, their support on OWhat.com partially reflected how much fans invested on their favorite Trainees. 

Please keep in mind that we only collected data from "total ranking" page on OWhat links that are under the Trainees' names as of 2019-04-06 07:00 AM Beijing Time, the day of the finals. Multiple websites were actually used to collect the supports during the competition and it was up to the fans which websites to use, so the results here cannot 100% represent the total support. 

Enjoy!
